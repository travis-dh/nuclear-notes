# Notes on Nuclear Physics
This repository has a bash script which scrapes courses `NUCS 342` from Simon Fraser University and `PHGN 422` from Colorado School of Mines.

If a system argument is given, then the folders for the corresponding lecture notes will be saved there. Otherwise, the notes will be saved in the `HOME` directory.

### Example Usage
`./scrape_notes.sh /my_dir/`
